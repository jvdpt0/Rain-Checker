# Rain-Checker
 
Rain Checker is a python script that uses Open Weather Map's API to check the weather forecast for the next 12 hours, based on your longitude and latitude, and detects wether it will rain or not, if it detects rain the script will use Twillio's API to send an SMS remembering the user to bring out an umbrella.
